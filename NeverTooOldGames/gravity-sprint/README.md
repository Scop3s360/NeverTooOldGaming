# Gravity Sprint

## Game Type
Endless Runner

## Theme
Minimalist sci-fi aesthetic - clean lines, neon colors, abstract geometric obstacles

## Concept
Endless runner where you flip gravity instead of jumping. Navigate through obstacles by switching between floor and ceiling. Sprint through an ever-changing gravitational field.

## Unique Twist
Traditional endless runners have you jump over obstacles. Gravity Sprint replaces jumping with gravity flipping, creating a disorienting but addictive mechanic where you're constantly switching between floor and ceiling perspectives.
