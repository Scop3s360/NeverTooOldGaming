# Mirror Maze

## Game Type
Puzzle Platformer

## Theme
Minimalist dual-world aesthetic - light and shadow, mirrored environments, clean geometric design

## Concept
Control two characters simultaneously - one is the shadow/mirror of the other. Both must reach their respective goals to complete each level. One character moves normally while the shadow moves in reverse or mirrored patterns.

## Core Mechanics
- Simultaneous dual-character control
- Shadow character mirrors or reverses movements
- Single-screen puzzle levels
- Both characters must reach their goals
- Environmental obstacles affect each differently

## Unique Twist
Unlike traditional platformers where you control one character, Mirror Maze challenges spatial reasoning by requiring you to think about two movement patterns at once. The shadow's mirrored movement creates brain-bending puzzles.

## Planned Features
- Dual character control system
- Mirror/reverse movement mechanics
- 20-30 puzzle levels
- Progressive difficulty
- Undo/restart functionality
- Minimal, elegant UI
