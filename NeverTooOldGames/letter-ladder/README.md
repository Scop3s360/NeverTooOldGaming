# Letter Ladder

## Game Type
Word Puzzle

## Theme
Clean, typography-focused design - elegant fonts, minimal colors, word-game aesthetic

Transform one word into another by changing one letter at a time. Each intermediate step must be a valid word. Climb the "ladder" from start word to target word with limited moves.
