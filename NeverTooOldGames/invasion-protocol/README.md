# Invasion Protocol

## Game Type
Reverse Tower Defense

## Theme
Dark fantasy invasion - you're the monster horde attacking a kingdom, gothic castle, creature designs

## Concept
Play as the invading army. Send waves of units to overwhelm the castle defenses and reach the throne. Execute your invasion protocol to breach the fortress.

## Unique Twist
Flips traditional tower defense on its head - you're the attacker, not the defender. Strategic unit deployment replaces tower placement, creating a fresh perspective on the genre.

## Core Mechanics
- Send units along a path toward the castle
- Enemy towers try to stop your units
- Earn currency from units that survive
- Unlock stronger unit types
- Overwhelm defenses with strategy
