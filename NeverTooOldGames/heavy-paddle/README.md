# Heavy Paddle

## Game Type
Arcade Sports

## Theme
Retro arcade with a twist - classic Pong aesthetic with modern physics visualization

## Concept
Pong where paddle momentum matters. Move too much and your paddle becomes heavy and slow. Stay still and it becomes light and fast. Master the weight of your paddle to win.

## Unique Twist
Classic Pong rewards fast reflexes and constant movement. Heavy Paddle adds strategic depth by making your paddle gain weight as you move, forcing players to balance reactive play with careful positioning.

## Core Mechanics
- Classic Pong ball physics
- Paddle momentum system
- Movement builds "weight"
- Stillness reduces weight
- Strategic positioning vs reactive play

## Planned Features
- Single player vs AI
- Two player local multiplayer
- Momentum visualization
- Difficulty levels
- Score tracking
- Power-ups (optional)

## Development Status
- [ ] Basic Pong mechanics
- [ ] Momentum physics system
- [ ] Visual momentum feedback
- [ ] AI opponent
