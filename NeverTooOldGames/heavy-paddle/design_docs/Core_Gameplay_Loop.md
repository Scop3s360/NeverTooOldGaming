# Heavy Paddle - Core Gameplay Loop

## Moment-to-Moment Gameplay
1. Ball bounces between paddles
2. Player moves paddle to intercept ball
3. Movement builds paddle "weight"
4. Heavy paddle moves slower
5. Staying still reduces weight
6. Light paddle moves faster
7. Score point when opponent misses

## Primary Interaction
