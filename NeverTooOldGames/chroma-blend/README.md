# Chroma Blend

## Game Type
Color Puzzle

## Theme
Vibrant, educational art style - bright primary colors, paint splatter effects, artistic aesthetic

## Concept
Match-3 meets color theory. Combine primary colors to create secondary colors and clear the board. Blend colors strategically to create matches.

## Unique Twist
Instead of matching identical items like traditional match-3 games, Chroma Blend teaches color theory by requiring players to mix colors (red + blue = purple) before matching, adding an educational layer to puzzle gameplay.
