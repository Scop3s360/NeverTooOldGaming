# Repository Game Development Standards

## Engine Requirement

All games created in this repository MUST be built using Godot Engine.

## Game Design Philosophy

All games in this repository must be:
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and quick to learn
- **Quick to produce**: Focus on rapid development and iteration
- **Unique spin**: Offer a fresh twist or development on existing game concepts

## Current Version

- **Godot 4.5.1** is the current version in use (as seen in Match Master)

## Rationale

This ensures consistency across all projects in the repository, allowing for:
- Shared knowledge and best practices
- Reusable components and scripts
- Consistent development workflow
- Unified tooling and export processes

## Application

This requirement applies to:
- All existing games (Match Master, Siege and Storm, Vein Hunter)
- Any new games added to this repository in the future

## Language

- **GDScript** is the primary scripting language for Godot projects
- C# may be used if specifically required, but GDScript is preferred
