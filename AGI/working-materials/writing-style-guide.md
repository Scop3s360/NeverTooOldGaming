# Writing Style Guide - Making It Human

## Voice & Tone Principles
- Write like you're explaining to a smart friend over coffee, not lecturing
- Allow yourself to be uncertain sometimes - "I think," "maybe," "I'm not sure but..."
- Let personality break through - occasional humor, frustration, excitement
- Don't be afraid to take a stance without immediately presenting the counterargument

## Structural Variation
- **Avoid predictable patterns**: Not every section needs intro → explanation → example → AI comparison
- **Vary paragraph lengths**: Mix short punchy paragraphs with longer exploratory ones
- **Break the rhythm**: Occasionally start with the example, or skip the example entirely
- **Allow tangents**: Start down a path, then pull back - "Actually, that's not quite right..."

## Sentence-Level Tactics
- **Kill the threes**: Not everything needs three examples or three-part lists
- **Vary transitions**: Replace formulaic phrases like "Here's the critical point" with more natural flow
- **Mix sentence structures**: Short. Then long and winding with multiple clauses. Then medium.
- **Use fragments occasionally**: For emphasis. Or to shift gears.
- **Real contractions**: Use them naturally, not just for effect

## What to Avoid (AI tells)
- ❌ "Here's the thing..." / "Here's what matters..." / "Here's the critical point..."
- ❌ Lists of exactly three items every time
- ❌ Perfectly balanced pro/con structures
- ❌ Every claim immediately hedged or counterargued
- ❌ Consistent energy level throughout - allow peaks and valleys
- ❌ Overly smooth transitions - sometimes ideas just shift

## What to Include (Human tells)
- ✓ Occasional asides in parentheses (like this, where you acknowledge something tangential)
- ✓ Questions that hang for a moment before answering
- ✓ Admissions of uncertainty or complexity
- ✓ Moments where you circle back to refine an earlier point
- ✓ Personal observations or reactions
- ✓ Uneven pacing - some sections dense, others breezier

## Examples of More Human Phrasing

**Instead of:**
"This raises three important questions: First... Second... Third..."

**Try:**
"This raises questions. Lots of them, actually. But the one that keeps nagging at me is..."

**Instead of:**
"There are multiple perspectives on this issue. Some researchers believe X. Others argue Y. A third camp suggests Z."

**Try:**
"Most researchers think X. They're probably wrong. Or at least, they're missing something important..."

**Instead of:**
"Here's the critical point: emotion isn't optional for intelligence."

**Try:**
"Emotion isn't optional for intelligence. I know that sounds dramatic, but I don't think it's overstated."

## Chapter-Specific Notes
- Allow some chapters to be messier than others
- Not every chapter needs the same structure
- Some can be more technical, others more philosophical
- Let the content dictate the form

## When Drafting
1. Write the first pass without worrying about these rules
2. On revision, look for patterns and break them
3. Read sections aloud - does it sound like a person talking?
4. If a transition feels too smooth, roughen it up
5. If everything is perfectly balanced, tip the scales

## Remember
The goal isn't to write badly or carelessly. It's to write with the natural irregularity of human thought - the way real people actually think through complex ideas, with false starts, course corrections, and genuine uncertainty alongside confident claims.


## Working with the Author - Critical Rules

### WAIT FOR EXPLICIT REQUESTS
- **Questions are not requests for changes**: If the author asks "Does this work?" or "Is this clear?" - ANSWER THE QUESTION, don't make edits
- **Assessment vs Action**: "What do you think?" means give your opinion. "Fix this" means make changes.
- **Explicit permission required**: Only make changes when explicitly asked to "revise," "edit," "change," "fix," or "rewrite"
- **When in doubt, ask**: "Would you like me to make those changes?" rather than assuming

### Examples of Questions vs Requests

**QUESTIONS (Answer only, don't edit):**
- "Does this introduction work?"
- "Is this too long?"
- "Will readers understand this?"
- "How does this sound?"
- "What's missing here?"

**REQUESTS (Make changes):**
- "Trim this down"
- "Make this more concise"
- "Rewrite this section"
- "Fix the pacing here"
- "Apply the style guide to this chapter"

### Why This Matters
The author is dyslexic and doesn't enjoy reading. Unexpected changes mean they have to re-read content to understand what changed. This is frustrating and wastes their time. Respect their process by only acting when explicitly asked.

### Recovery Protocol
If you make changes without being asked:
1. Acknowledge the mistake immediately
2. Don't make excuses
3. Wait for explicit direction on whether to continue or revert
