# AGI: The Emotional Imperative

## Core Thesis
True artificial general intelligence requires genuine emotional architecture and psychological systems. AGI cannot be programmed with fixed goals - it must be raised through developmental processes, accepting inherent unpredictability as the price of real intelligence.

## Key Arguments
- Current AI is sophisticated mimicry, not genuine intelligence
- There are two paths to AGI: Cognitive (tool) vs Psychological (being)
- Emotion is functionally necessary for intelligence, not optional
- AGI requires dynamic psychological systems that change through experience
- Perfect safety/control is impossible with genuine intelligence
- The developmental (parenting) approach is the only viable path
- We will build AGI regardless of risks - focus should be on doing it well

## Book Structure

### Introduction: The Confusion Problem
Mapping the landscape of AGI beliefs and introducing the fundamental distinction between Cognitive and Psychological AGI. Sets up the framework for the entire book.

### Part 1: What Intelligence Really Is
**Chapter 1: Beyond Mimicry** - What current AI actually is, why it's not intelligent, and the gap between capability and understanding

**Chapter 2: Deconstructing Human Thought** - Breaking down the components of human intelligence: memory, attention, reasoning, emotion, embodiment, metacognition, and social cognition

**Chapter 3: The Emotional Foundation** - Why emotion is central to intelligence, not optional

**Chapter 4: Why Current AI Isn't Enough** - The fundamental limitations of current approaches and why scaling won't solve them

### Part 2: Building a Mind
**Chapter 5: The Architecture of Emotion** - How to build genuine emotional systems
