# Shape Shift

## Theme
Neon cyberpunk - glowing geometric shapes, dark backgrounds, bright neon colors (pink, cyan, purple), synthwave aesthetic

## Concept
Physics-based merge game inspired by Suika Game. Drop geometric shapes that merge on contact, creating chain reactions and evolving through shape tiers.

## Unique Mechanics

### 1. Shape Transformation Chain
Shapes evolve through geometric progression:
- Circle → Triangle → Square → Pentagon → Hexagon → Octagon → Star → Supernova

### 2. Neon Reaction System
- Merged shapes emit neon shockwaves
- Shockwaves trigger nearby merges
- Chain reactions = massive score multipliers
- Visual neon pulse effects

### 3. Gravity Flip
- Button to rotate gravity (up/down/left/right)
- Strategic repositioning of shapes
- Costs points to use
- Adds puzzle element to physics gameplay

## Core Mechanics
- Drop shapes from top
- Physics-based falling and collision
- Merge identical shapes on contact
- Chain reactions for combos
- Gravity manipulation for strategy

## Planned Features
- Physics container (shapes fall and stack)
- 8 shape tiers with evolution animations
- Neon shockwave particle effects
- Gravity rotation mechanic
- Score system with multipliers
- High score tracking
- Game over when container overflows
